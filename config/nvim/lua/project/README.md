# Neovim Project

A plugin to help you navigate between projects and customize different tools to be specific to your project.

## TODO:
[ ] Validate that config paths are correct (when change the project directory); maybe add a function to check the health of the project
[ ] Add functions to add/remove (all) keybindings
[ ] Research how to exclude certain directories/files? (what is the application for this?)
[ ] Test functionality with a lua project (nvim lua project?)
[ ] Test functionality with a python project
[ ] Add some official/regression tests
