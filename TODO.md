* nvim:		- automatically (maybe by scripts) configure IAR projects (build/compile_commands.json generation)
		  there is already a command for iarbuild that can be used: debug/investigate why it doesn't work
* nvim:		- configure folds (https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/psl8rq/sexy_folds/)
* fonts:	- save the used font in the repo under 'fonts' and create a script that 'installs' the fonts
* nvim:		- git signs? or some sort of other such plugin
* nvim:		- symbol-outline plugin - install and use
* nvim:		- leap.nvim - should I use it? (maybe install and test-drive a couple of weeks)
* nvim:		- DAP usage; here there are a few options:
		  1. try to use the Typescript adapter (??? I don't remember which project?)
		  2. try to compile DAP support for arm-none-eabi-gcc compiler (since it's already been added as a patch)
		  3. try to use 'vimspector'? or some other plugin that interacts directly with the GDB server
* remote:	- setup remote with flusing scripts / automatic build
* nvim:		- go through 'awesome nvim' plugins to decide which plugins could be helpfull
		  (rate them into: 1. have to have them (or maybe just those)
		                   2. maybe
				   3. I don't need them
* nvim:		- watch all TJDevries videos and do the exercises
* nvim:		- color #ifdefs differently (or just remove them entirely for clarity)
